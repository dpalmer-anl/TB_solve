Solver Utilities Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial demonstrates the helper functions in ``tb_solve.utils`` designed to assist in choosing the right solver and parameters.

Key utilities covered:

* ``Solver_helper``: Estimates computation time for various solvers.
* ``Get_optimal_solver``: Automatically selects the fastest method.
* ``Converge_Solver_settings``: Finds stable parameters (e.g., number of moments).
